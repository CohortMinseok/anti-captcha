Anti-Captcha doesn't provide any project code for C++ and I wanted to post an example of how easily you can utilize the api using libcurl and json.
There are many other ways of going about it, but I found this solution pretty straight forward.
I only needed this function to solve basic math, letter, and symbol based captchas but you should be able easily convert to their other services.
